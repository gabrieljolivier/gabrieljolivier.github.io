## [Syllabus](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22895843/Intro_Microeconomics_Syllabus.pdf)

## Overview
This course provides students with a basic overview of supply and demand, market competition, consumer behavior, producer behavior, and different market structures. I emphasize understanding the assumptions that underlie economic models without over-relying on math, as it is vital for students to understand the necessary preconditions that make predictions of economic models valid. A large portion of the grade comes from weekly in-class assignments (graded based on effort rather than correctness), which give students a structured time to try out their economic knowledge in a comfortable setting with classmates and the instructor available for questions and moral support. There are also multiple exams throughout the semester, intended to give students multiple chances to demostrate their knowledge and learn from their mistakes.
