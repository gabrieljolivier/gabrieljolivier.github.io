I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Tulane University Economics Department, expecting degree conferral in May 2026. My research focuses on the economics of education, where I use quasi-experimental methods to estimate the causal effects of policy on educational outcomes. I study the effects of contemporary policy, such as the recent expansion of universal school vouchers and the most recent federal minimum wage increases, as well as historic policy, including integration busing and language bans in Louisiana schools. When I am not researching or teaching, I spend my time tending to my plants, skating with friends, and caring for my cat, Mr. Baby.
