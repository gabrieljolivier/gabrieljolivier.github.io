&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Tulane University Economics Department, \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; expecting degree conferral in May 2026. My research focuses on the economics \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of education, where I use quasi-experimental methods to estimate the \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; causal effects of policy on educational outcomes. I study the effects of \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; contemporary policy, such as the recent expansion of universal school vouchers \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the most recent federal minimum wage increases, as well as historic policy, \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; including integration busing and language bans in Louisiana schools. When \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am not researching or teaching, I spend my time tending to my plants, skating \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with friends, and caring for my cat, Mr. Baby.
