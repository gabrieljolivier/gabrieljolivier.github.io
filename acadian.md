_Abstract_: In 1755, French colonists were forcefully exiled from Acadie (present day New Brunswick and Nova Scotia) by the British, who desired their fertile farmland. Over half of these Acadians died during deportation and the survivors struggled to find a new home, finally landing and proliferating in Southern Louisiana and the surrounding areas. While White colonists, the Acadians brought with them a distinct culture and language that caused them to be targeted during the early 1900s wave of xenophobia in the U.S., which culminated in the 1921 Louisiana ban on Cajun French ("Cajun" is a bastardization of "Acadian") in public schools. Using a novel genealogical dataset following Acadians descendants from expulsion to the current day, I plan to investigate the effects of the 1921 ban on the educational attainment of Acadian descendants by comparing attainment between descendants from Louisiana (affected by the ban) and East Texas (not affected by the ban). With climate change worsening, the probability of forced expulsion over resource disputes only rises, and it is important to understand what happens to these groups when they face state oppression in their new homes.
