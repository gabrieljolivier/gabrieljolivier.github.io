&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Tulane University Economics Department, expecting \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; degree conferral in May 2026. My research focuses on the economics of education, \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  where I use quasi-experimental research designs to estimate the causal effects of \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  policy on educational outcomes I study the effects of contemporary policy, such as \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the recent expansion of universal school vouchers and the most recent federal \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  minimum wage increases, as well as historic policy, including integration busing \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the language bans in Louisiana schools. When I am not researching or \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; teaching, I spend my time trying to be outside with friends, either roller skating \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; around Audubon Park or basking in the sun in the backyard.
