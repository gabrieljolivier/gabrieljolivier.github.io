  <dd> I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Tulane University Economics Department, expecting degree conferral in May 2026. My research focuses on the economics of education,  where I use quasi-experimental research designs to estimate the causal effects of policy on educational outcomes I study the effects of contemporary policy, such as the recent expansion of universal school vouchers and the most recent federal minimum wage increases, as well as historic policy, including integration busing and the language bans in Louisiana schools. When I am not researching or teaching, I spend my time trying to be outside with friends, either roller skating around Audubon Park or basking in the sun in the backyard. </dd>
