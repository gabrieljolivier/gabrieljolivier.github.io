&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Tulane University Economics Department, \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; expecting degree conferral in May 2026. My research focuses on the economics \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of education, where I use quasi-experimental research designs to estimate the \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; causal effects of policy on educational outcomes I study the effects of \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; contemporary policy, such as the recent expansion of universal school vouchers \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the most recent federalminimum wage increases, as well as historic policy, \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; including integration busing and the language bans in Louisiana schools. \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I am not researching or teaching, I spend my time trying to be outside with friends, either roller skating \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; around Audubon Park or basking in the sun in the backyard.
